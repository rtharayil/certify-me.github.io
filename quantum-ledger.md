Feature1Title: Quantum Ledger Has Become The New Standard for Data Integration in Digital Credentials
Feature1Text: Quantum Ledger provides a state-of-the-art data security mechanism as it has no single point of failure because it runs on many nodes in parallel, which can be located anywhere in the world. It is also highly scalable as more nodes are added without any downside since Quantum Ledger becomes more fault tolerant and more reliable with the number of nodes available. <br> Quantum ledger-integrated digital credentials are future-proof against the potential threat of quantum computers. No matter how advanced quantum computing gets, the security and privacy of digital credentials remain intact.
