                <p>Passionate about creating meaningful digital experiences that bridge the gap between user needs and business objectives.

                <div class="journey-title">My Journey</div>
                <div class="journey-text">
                    My journey began in 2018 with a simple question: why do some websites feel intuitive while others frustrate users? This curiosity led me down a rabbit hole of design principles, user psychology, and the beautiful intersection of art and technology. I started with basic HTML and CSS, slowly building my foundation in web development.<br><br>
                    
                    The real transformation came during the pandemic in 2020 when the world went digital. This forced me to think deeply about user experiences and accessibility. I immersed myself in learning React, studying design systems, and understanding how to create interfaces that work seamlessly across all devices and abilities.<br><br>
                    
                    Through countless hours of prototyping, testing, and iterating, I discovered that great design isn't just about aesthetics—it's about solving real problems for real people. Every pixel placement, every interaction, every decision tells a story and guides users through their digital journey.<br><br>
                    
                    Today, I see myself not just as a designer or developer, but as an advocate for users. I've learned to balance user needs with business objectives, aesthetic beauty with functional simplicity, and creative innovation with established patterns. My focus has evolved to creating inclusive, accessible designs that serve everyone.<br><br>
                    
                    This journey has taught me that empathy is the most powerful tool in a designer's toolkit. Understanding user pain points, conducting thorough research, and iterating based on feedback have become second nature. Every project I work on is an opportunity to make digital experiences more meaningful and accessible.

            <h3>Future</h3>
            <p>The future of UI/UX is incredibly exciting. With emerging technologies like AI, VR/AR, and voice interfaces, the canvas for creating experiences is expanding exponentially. I'm committed to staying at the forefront of these changes, always learning, always growing, and always putting the user at the center of everything I create.</p>
