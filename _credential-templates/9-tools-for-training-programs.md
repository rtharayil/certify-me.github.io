Let’s say you’ve been asked to run a student workshop or design onboarding for new administrative interns. It feels like a lot, right? Between planning content, organizing attendance, and making sure people actually learn something—it’s easy to get overwhelmed.

But here’s the truth: a solid training program doesn’t start with a mountain of content. It starts with a few smart tools. Tools that make your job easier and your learners’ experience smoother.

Think of it like organizing a potluck dinner. If you don’t have enough plates or someone forgets to bring cutlery, the whole thing can turn chaotic. Training works the same way. You need tools that help you set the table before anyone takes a bite.

In this blog, we’ll walk through 9 essential tools to help you set up and run effective training—whether you’re a student leader, part of the registrar’s office, or an educator experimenting with digital learning.

But before we jump into the toolkit, let’s get clear on why these tools matter in the first place.

<br>

## Why Tools Matter in Modern Training Programs

**Training isn’t just about content—it’s about delivery, structure, and follow-up.**

You can have the most well-researched material in the world, but if it’s scattered across ten folders, hard to share, and impossible to track, your learners won’t get much out of it. That’s where tools come in.

They help you:

1. Organize your materials in one place

1. Track who’s learning and how they’re doing

1. Communicate without flooding inboxes

1. Collect feedback and improve over time

And the best part? Many of these tools are [free or low-cost credential management solutions](https://www.certifyme.online/blog/Top-Free-Digital-Credential-Management-Software.html). You don’t need fancy software. You just need the right setup.

<br>

## Before You Begin: 3 Quick Questions to Ask

Before picking tools, pause and ask:

**1. Who is your audience?**
    Students, staff, interns, volunteers? Different groups may prefer different formats—some like videos, others prefer live sessions.

**2. What’s your goal?**
    Are you training for awareness, building a skill, or onboarding someone into a role?

**3. How will you measure success?**
    Completion rate? A feedback score? Behavior change?

Knowing these answers helps you choose tools that fit—rather than piling on tech just because it looks shiny.

## The 9 Tools You’ll Want in Your Training Toolkit

<img class="img-fluid r-16" src="/img/blog/educational-technology-tools.png" alt="Tools that are needed in training toolkit" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

<br>

**1. Customer Relationship Management (CRM)** <br>

**Know Your People Before You Train Them**

Let’s start with the most overlooked part of training: people management. A CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system might sound like something only sales teams need. But trust me—it's a gem for training too.

At its core, a CRM is like a digital notebook where you track every individual’s interaction with your training program. Want to remember who attended what session? Who asked for extra resources? Who still hasn’t completed their onboarding? CRM handles that.

**Real-Life Example:** Imagine you're part of a student organization planning weekly skill sessions. You want to follow up with those who missed the last session, share resources with top performers, or even send out [certificates using a reliable certificate maker](https://certifyme.online/blog/15-certificate-maker.html). A CRM like **HubSpot** or **Zoho CRM** lets you tag participants, send them targeted emails, and keep all this information neat and searchable.

**Pro Tip:** Start with free versions. Don’t try to use all features right away—just the ones that help you stay organized.

<br>

**2. Learning Management System (LMS)** 

**Your Virtual Classroom That Doesn’t Sleep**

If you’ve ever taken an online course, you’ve probably used an LMS. It's your digital training ground. From organizing lessons and uploading documents to tracking progress and assessing knowledge, the LMS is the control center.

Think of it like this: If a CRM is your filing cabinet, the LMS is your classroom, library, and gradebook rolled into one.

**Popular Picks:**

**1. Moodle** – widely used in universities <br>
**2. Canvas** – user-friendly and cloud-based

**Analogy:** It’s like Netflix for learning. Courses are arranged neatly, learners can pick up where they left off, and everything’s tracked.
    
**Tip:** Choose an LMS that integrates easily with your existing tools—like Google Workspace or your university email system.

<br>

**3. Assessment Tools** 

**Check Understanding, Don’t Just Assume It**

You don’t want your learners to just show up; you want them to get it. That’s where assessments come in. Quizzes, feedback forms, and polls are simple ways to check how much learners are absorbing.

**Practical Uses:**

1. After a session, send a short quiz using **Google Forms**<br>
1. Use **Quizizz** or **Kahoot** for more gamified assessments<br>
1. Anonymous reflection forms using **Microsoft Forms**

**Example:** A student-run peer mentoring group can use weekly quizzes to review topics, sharing them easily via QR codes during sessions. One can use the best [QR Code Generators](https://www.the-qrcode-generator.com/) to create and customize these codes for quick access. The results not only help mentors adjust sessions but also show learners what they still need to work on.

**Tip:** Mix it up—use MCQs, short answers, or even open-ended questions to keep learners engaged.

<br>

**4. Authoring Tools** <br>

**Create Once, Share Many Times**

Training content doesn’t magically appear. Someone has to make it—and that’s where authoring tools come in. These help you build slides, interactive activities, or self-paced modules. Similarly, [AI phone calls](https://convin.ai/product/automated-virtual-ai-agents) can automate the delivery of training content, making it more efficient and accessible for learners.

**Top Choices:**

1. **Articulate Rise** – beautiful and intuitive <br>
1. **Adobe Captivate** – great for detailed course building <br>

**Think of Them Like:** Design tools for educators. They’re like Canva but tailored for learning.

**Scenario:** Imagine designing an orientation module for new teaching assistants. With Rise, you can add videos, checklists, reflection prompts, and more.

**Tip:** If you’re short on time, use pre-built templates. They make your content look polished even if you’re new to the game.
