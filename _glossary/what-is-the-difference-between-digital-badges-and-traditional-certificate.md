Both digital badges and traditional certificates aim to recognize achievements, but they differ in format, security, and manner of sharing. With verification and tamper-resistance becoming essential, digital badges offer a modern alternative to paper-based credentials.

This blog explores the key differences between the two to help you understand which suits your needs better.

## What is a Traditional Certificate?

The definition of a traditional certificate is that it is a piece of paper formally stating a fact about someone or something. For instance, if a student has graduated in a discipline such as computer science, a degree certificate from the university will state this as fact, proving the individual’s achievement. 

Certificates have been around for two or three centuries, but in recent decades, they have been standardised by many organizations, such as the [International Organization for Standardization](https://www.iso.org/home.html#:~:text=ISO%3A%20the%20International,for%20everyone%2C%20everywhere). However, the physical document still lacks accessibility and shareability, which digital formats like images and PDFs address, but leave an issue with the document's authenticity.

## What is a Digital Badge?

A digital badge or credential, on the other hand, is an electronic form of a document secured using encryption methods. It can be easily shared and verified by anyone at any time. Unlike traditional paper certificates, which are difficult to validate and prone to forgery, digital badges contain tamper-proof metadata, which is verifiable information about the recipient and their noted achievement.

Digital badges also follow standards such as Open Badges 3.0 and W3C Verifiable Credentials, embedding cryptographic signatures that enable instant, independent verification of authenticity.

### Format and Delivery

**Traditional Certificate:** The traditional certificates exist in a physical format, i.e. paper or [PVC cards](https://www.entrust.com/resources/learn/guide-to-pvc-id-cards-and-printers#:~:text=Why%20is%20PVC,other%20sophisticated%20technology.). However, they can be digitized by scanning or photographing them. 

**Digital Badge:** A digital badge exists entirely online on the web from the day of issuance and is stored in the recipient's digital wallet. 

<br>

### Security & Tamper-Proofing

**Traditional Certificate:** When it comes to security, the physical certificate or its digital form is prone to forgery or alteration. 

**Digital Badge:** Being cryptographically signed, a digital badge is impossible to alter or be tampered with.  

<br>

### Shareability

**Traditional Certificate:** A physical document can be shared only as a hard copy or a PDF via mail. But lack of portability and easy verification limits the shareability of it.

**Digital Badge:** With a digital badge, you can share it with anyone via a dedicated web link or on social media platforms with a single click. It is a great feature for universities, colleges and e-learning platforms as it brings in organic referral traffic through each social media share. Most digital credential software, such as [CertifyMe](https://www.certifyme.online/), integrates this feature into its platform. 

<br>

### Verification

**Traditional Certificate:** Verifying the authenticity of a traditional certificate can be very complex because it must be matched against the issuer's records. So, if an HR needs to verify a certificate, they must call or email the issuer to confirm its legitimacy.

**Digital Badge:** A digital credential, on the other hand, is easily verifiable as the issuer cryptographically signs it. Any third party can verify the certificate via ID tagging, a cryptographic key or OTP verification.

<br>

### Expiration

**Traditional Certificate:** If your issued certificate or document must expire, the expiry date can be printed on the certificate itself, but it can still be altered and misused even after it expires. 

**Digital Badge:** A digital badge can not only have an expiry date but also be revoked from the rewardee instantly when it reaches its expiry date. It means the rewardee will not have access to the document until the reissuance. Once the document expires, it will not be verified as authentic via the link or QR code.

## Conclusion

At a glance, a traditional certificate and a digital badge might seem similar, but under the hood, digital badges represent decades of technological progress. They offer far greater security, flexibility, and reliability, making them a strong, modern alternative to traditional formats.
