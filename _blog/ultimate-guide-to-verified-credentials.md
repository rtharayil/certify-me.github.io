<br>

### Key Components of Verified Credentials

At their heart, verified credentials function through a straightforward trust system involving three key participants:

1. **Issuer:** A trusted organization, such as a university or employer, responsible for creating and issuing the credential.
1. **Holder:** The individual who owns, manages, and decides when and with whom to share their credential.
1. **Verifier:** The party, like a recruiter or government agency, that confirms the authenticity of the credential.

This triangular relationship ensures a seamless process where credentials are issued, held securely, and verified effortlessly, forming the backbone of trust in a digital ecosystem.

<br>

### How Blockchain and Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) Support Verified Credentials

Blockchain is the technology that ensures trust in verified credentials by providing an unchangeable record of every credential issued. 

Once a credential is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted, making it reliable and secure for anyone who needs to verify it. This gives both individuals and organizations confidence that the credentials they’re dealing with are accurate and tamper-proof.

Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) add another layer of security by allowing individuals to control their own identity without needing to rely on central authorities like banks or governments. 

Instead of having personal information stored in one centralized database, DIDs allow people to manage their credentials independently. 

This combination of blockchain and DIDs ensures a more secure, transparent, and user-controlled way of verifying credentials that is ready for the future.

<br>

### The Difference Between Centralized and Decentralized Identifiers
Traditional verification systems rely on central authorities, such as universities or employers, to store and manage data. This centralized approach can lead to delays, errors, and security breaches, as all records are stored in one place. 

If this central system is compromised, it could expose sensitive information or disrupt the verification process.

Decentralized systems, however, give control back to the individual. Instead of relying on a central authority, people can manage their own credentials and share them securely. 

This not only improves privacy but also enhances security, as there’s no single point of failure. By decentralizing the process, the system becomes more reliable, faster, and less prone to fraud or errors.
