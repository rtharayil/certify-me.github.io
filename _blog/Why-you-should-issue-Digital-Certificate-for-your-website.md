# Why you should issue Digital Certificate for your website


## What are Digital SSL Certificates?

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), often known as TLS, is a technology for encrypting Web traffic and authenticating the identity of servers. An SSL certificate authenticates a website's identity and establishes a secure connection.

After the SSL installation is complete, you can securely access your service using HTTPS or other SSL protocols like FTPS, IMAPS, NNTPS, LDAPS, and so on.

How do Digital SSL certificates help websites?

Organizations who want to use SSL certificates to encrypt their websites must first install these SSL digital certificates on their web servers. This helps them keep their web browser activities safe. An organization will need to go through numerous levels of evaluation depending upon the nature of the SSL certificate they choose. A website connection with an "https://" URL is made after an SSL certificate is successfully installed, causing the website to initiate a secure network with the web browser.

## Types of SSL Certificates:

Domain Validation: It's a moderate certificate for small businesses that just requires the certificate authority to verify domain ownership. It is the most cost-effective SSL certification available.
Organization Validation: The certificate authority must verify the domain ownership as well as the business (CA). The organization's information must be searchable in online public databases, and the organization's contact information must be confirmed. Additional papers for authentication may be required to obtain an OV certificate.
Extended Validation: This certificate is utilized by major enterprises, e-commerce enterprises, social networking sites, banking, and government sectors because it provides the highest form of encryption and security. The requirements for EV certification include the same conditions as for OV certificates, as well as additional prerequisites and paperwork, such as the organization's registration and it must be operating for more than 3 years; alternatively, the CA may request further paperwork.

## Benefits of Digital SSL certificate:

SSL digital certificates protect users' sensitive information and remove the risk of online fraud and other cyber-attacks by allowing a secure connection between the browser and the server. It also helps users to conduct monetary or banking transactions without the risk of data theft on the website or online portal. 

SSL certificates enable websites to rank higher on search engine results pages, which helps to increase brand recognition and traffic. SSL certificates with an "https://" URL serve to instill trust in web browsers and generate potential leads, hence enhancing site visibility.
