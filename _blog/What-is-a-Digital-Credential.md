**A Quick Overview**
<br>
We are rapidly shifting to a digital world where everything is online. This virtual world has a list of advantages that people or organizations adopting it explicitly experience. The certification process is also a part of the ongoing digitalization. 
For ages, people indulged in dubious certification practices such as credentials forgery. Another common issue people often face with paper certificates is the risk of losing them. To address such issues, <a href="https://certifyme.online/blog/Experiencing-Digital-Certificate-and-Digital-badge.html">digital certificates and badges</a> have become the new norm.<br><br>We all hold several credentials (not only in the form of academic certificates but also passports, driving licenses, security documents, and many more). Keeping all of these in a safe and secure place all the time can be chaotic sometimes. 
Online courses are also in high demand recently, so delivering physical credentials to students unnecessarily costs the entire system. When safety, efficiency, and ease are questioned, there is nothing better than online credentials.<br>Digital certificates mainly address the question of certificate authentication and verification. These credentials reduce the gap between the day of course completion and the actual day on which awardees receive the certificates. The seamless digital credentialing process enables same-day certification. What can be more exhilarating than receiving certificates on the day the course gets over?<br><br><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/">Verifiable Credentials</a> are not only for awarding course certificates; they are also perfect for storing and securing government or organizational information.<br>
**As a lengthy discussion on digital certificates is already ongoing, let’s find out the definition of digital credentials for more insights:**
<br>
The digital credential is the digital equivalent of paper-based certificates. When an institution honors a student/applicant for their efforts in achieving a degree or completing a program, the certificate they receive comes via a digital mode following a digital certification process.<br>
The digital certificates contain minute details that earlier weren’t possible to include in paper certificates. 
The QR/BARcode in the certificate unlocks information about the competency of the awardee. The skills the student possessed to be a part of the program or the skills they have developed during the course, all these details remain locked in the code. Simply scanning it uncovers information that a potential employer or institution seeks.<br>Both digital badges and digital certificates fall under this category. The primary difference between a digital badge and a digital certificate is its way of representation. However, per common belief or academic structure, digital badges are awarded to recognize step-by-step development, whereas digital certificates are for completion.

## Why Digital Credentials Became the Talk of the Town?

We all were awarding, claiming, and using paper certificates to exhibit our talent and authenticity. Then what shifted the attention to <a href="https://certifyme.online/blog/The-Importance-of-Including-Digital-Credentials-on-LinkedIn.html">LinkedIn shareable certificates & badges</a>?<br>
Though paper certificates were traditionally popular and accepted, their issues troubled everyone. From altering the details inside a certificate to the presentation of fraud certificates, the problems were endless. There is also no way to detect whether any information falsification happened.<br>
The problem escalates when organizations hire forged certificate holders as their employees. It not only risks the reputation of the institution but can threaten other innocents as well. Doctors, nurses, lawyers, police, workers, or anyone can pose a significant threat to society by modifying the authentic details.<br>
There are several such incidents reported in every corner of the globe:<br>

- In India, Anilkumar, an administrative assistant in the superintendent’s office at MCH, <a href="https://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2023/feb/18/prime-accused-remanded-in-birth-certificate-forgery-casein-kochi-2548487.html">forged the birth certificate</a> for a six-month-old girl who a Tripunithura-based couple was illegally raising.
- Another recent incident in India <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vadodara/2-nurses-booked-for-forging-certificates/articleshow/97540272.cms?from=mdr">reports</a> the forgery of certificates by 2 nurses for promotion.Something similar <a href="https://www.vanguardngr.com/2023/03/certificate-forgery-43-nigerian-nurses-face-criminal-charges-in-us/">happened</a> in the USA in 2023 as well. 43 Nigerian nurses were barred from nursing practice by the USA law.
- A 2022 <a href="https://www.sakshipost.com/news/hyderabad/chennai-police-arrested-telangana-student-using-fake-certificates-secure-us-student">news article</a> states how a Telangana student forged a certificate for a US student visa.
- A conman in the UK was sentenced to jail for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/conman-sentenced-for-selling-forged-exam-certificates">selling fake certifications</a>.
- Even the number of <a href="https://apnews.com/article/coronavirus-pandemic-business-health-germany-europe-9dac134f0da260850b815612ad3af311">fake vaccination certificates</a> is on the rise in Germany.<br>

Sharing PDFs does not offer any protection from certificate forgery. Altering PDF information is also possible and straightforward, even for novices. You will come across an unprecedented number of fake certification cases all over the internet. Some are reported, while most go unnoticed and unreported. It poses a severe problem in the real world in real-time.
Digital credentials can be the safest and ideal answer to this issue. The rise of online courses and awareness among people or organizations make online certificates mainstream. The ease of verifying the details and popularity of skill-based hiring make digital credentials software beneficial.

Just scanning the code unleashes all the essential information that reveals the course/program details. It includes details on the qualification the awardee holds to be qualified for the program, how they have performed, the skills the student has acquired, and the jobs for which they are qualified.<br>All this crucial information is available a click away on the same day or in a day or two since the course completion changes the certification process. It streamlines the complete program and expedites the hiring process.<br>

<br>

The ease of integrating the digital credentials software in the current LMSs saves hours of manual labour.<br>A course provider might take nearly three to four months to provide certificates to all students. The higher the number of awardees, the longer the delay is.<br>However, automation of the certification procedure streamlines the system that minimizes the timeframe required for certificate delivery.<br>Students receive mail from the organization containing the certificates and can download, print, or share them on social media. Digital credentials are elementary to share across email, social media, or messaging platforms with a click.<br>

The portability and ease of verification make verifiable badges popular among awardees.<br>

The verifier can only access the details when the awardee allows them. 
<br>

**Authentic Record Keeping**
<br>
Any skills students gain from attending a course, session, or program remain locked in the certificate for a lifetime. The job portal integration facility is also a great feature that enables awardees to explore how suitable the job market is for them and the open positions associated with the skills/course.<br>
