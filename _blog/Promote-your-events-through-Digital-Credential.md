# Promote your events through Digital Credential

In the earlier days, manufacturing and issuing paper-based certificates was a tough task for the organisations as factors affecting the process were limited. Production materials were expensive and the waste contributed to environmental degradation. Although there has been a significant rise in new technology and tools minimising the production cost, the production waste still exists. 

Apart from that, promoting the certification event and program was rigorous and costs included a promotion, advertising, labour, travel and accommodation. These costs were not only expensive but also were time-consuming and utilised a lot of labour hindering the productivity and progress of the employees.

However, with the rise in digitalisation and the recent pandemic, every industry, organisation and educational program had to remote. This overnight change had created a lot of buzz with employees finding it hard to work and manage their regular activities.

Organisations had to issue new digital skills training programs to groom their employees with the new digital platforms and also had to keep in check their mental health and emotional capabilities. 

As per McKinsey report, although the global pandemic made the whole world go remote, the end to this is barely visible and remote learning is going to be here for the long run. The rise in virtual learning or traditional classrooms has introduced a new era of learning to individuals.

With new entries of educational programs and the existing programs getting stronger, the competition to stay relevant goes on. Events and educational programs need to be promoted and advertised to attract traffic and gain new leads and members.

As the digital platforms work completely virtual, promotion of events needs to be done through Digital Marketing, analytical tools, Content marketing and email marketing.

Even with all these marketing strategies, Why Would a learner invest in your program?

Learners need their efforts to get recognised and wish to display them on their portfolios or for employment. This can be done if educational programs issue a legitimate Digital Credential for the learners. 

##Digital Credentials includes Digital Certificate and Digital Badges. 

These digital credentials come with blockchain technology and can be encrypted with a digital key to secure the contents of the credential issued. Digital Certificates and Digital Badges are shareable, traceable, verifiable and portable. This helps learners to gain legitimate credentials and share across all digital platforms to advance in their career and also will act as digital proof of their competency in the skills.

## In Conclusion:

Organisations and education platforms can promote their events with ease through digital credentials as they recognise their skills and achievements and help advance in their career.
