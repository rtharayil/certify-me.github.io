# Using Digital Badges for Internal Training


The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs study, 2020, proposes prioritising cloud computing, big data, and e-commerce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the survey, 43% of companies plan to reduce their staff as a result of technology integration, while 34% anticipate hiring more people as a result of technology integration.

As the in-demand skills are anticipated to change, the talent gap is expanding. Around 40% of employees are expected to undergo reskilling for six months, while a whopping 94% of employers expect their employees to learn new skills and techniques.

As a result, internal training programmes to fill up skill shortages are critical for firms and organisations to stay relevant and up-to-date with the expanding and rapid digitalisation across all industries, which is bringing new learning skills and information to the fore.

## Gamifying Digital Badges:

Gamifying internal training programs and course modules using digital badges will help the learner quantify their skills to advance in their career. Learners are considerably more focused on achieving the specified aim or going further through the programme when it is gamified since they are recognised with a digital badge that verifies their competency in the skill gained and progress made throughout the training process.

Gamification encourages people to perform better by providing constant challenges. It also ensures that everyone has an equal chance to participate. 

## Customised internal training:

Businesses and educational institutions must innovate and adapt their business strategies in light of current economic and digital changes. They must also allow for customised learning programmes to fill the skill gap created by the pandemic issue.

The learning programme should be developed to identify in-demand skills while also being relevant to the role. When executed with strategic planning, customized learning programmes are cost-effective and aid in the growth of organisations.

Virtual learning programmes can be reinforced by using digital technology, augmented reality, and live video sessions to provide the experience of in-person learning.

Micro-Credentials and stackable credentials:

Internal training programmes may give micro-credentials for minor accomplishments, which can be aggregated and saved in the credential wallet. If an employee is being educated in advanced Excel, for example, the trainers may give digital micro-credentials for each feature of advanced Excel, such as data mining, pivot tables, or data formatting.

Stackable credentials allow a learner to earn and collect credentials based on a variety of criteria, and they can be earned through a variety of certification programmes. Employees and students can construct a strong portfolio by stacking credentials, which is an accumulated credential that helps them go forward and achieve their goals.

### In Conclusion:

Internal training digital badges provide more information about what knowledge has been acquired across modules and courses, as well as serve as documentation of competencies attained. The use of digital badges opens up opportunities for networking and gaining new work experience, which boosts motivation and engagement. Employee viewpoints are also broadened through digital badges.
