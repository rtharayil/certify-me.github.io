# Digital Learning and Digital Certificates


With the recent global pandemic and the restrictions and policies that were followed with it, remote working was and continues to be the new norm. With the imposed lockdown and no-contact restrictions, it was hard for learners and students to access education on-site and hinder their educational process.

# What is Digital Learning?

Digital learning is a method of teaching that benefits students, learners, and professionals all over the world. It employs a variety of technology-assisted learning methodologies. Deeply integrated, personalized learning, and other methodologies that rely on digital resources in some way or another are all included.

Why and How Digital Learning helps Learners?

Digital learning may improve learning experiences, save educators time, allow teachers to better personalize learning to the requirements of their learners, aid in tracking student progress, enhance understanding into the process of learning for all users, and much more.

With the aid of a visual display of knowledge, technologically enhanced classes assist educators in transforming monotonous lectures into exciting and engaging meetings. The study material that is shared online is simple to transmit and exchange among participants from all over the world, and it may also be utilized to manage conversations and easy collaborations.

# The need for Digital Certificates:

With everything going remote or virtual, paper-based certifications are being replaced with digital credentials, which have proven to be more effective than ever in terms of easy sharing and verification of documents obtained, as well as proving competencies with skill, ability, or qualifications acquired.

The need for reskilling has led businesses to provide digital skills training programs for their staff to improve their abilities and get a better understanding of the latest digital skills, technologies, and solutions. Apart from that, businesses need to issue digital credentials like digital certificates and digital badges that act as evidence to prove the competencies acquired and demonstrate their skills for prospective future employees.

People are encouraged to enroll in digital skills training programs that issue a digital credential to strengthen and quantify their talents since Digital Credentials assist both organizations and their employees' progress and promote a strong brand value.

# Benefits of Digital Certificates:

Secure: Digital certificates are secured with bank-level encryption and can be enabled with a digital key or passcode to ensure the document is safe from any unauthorized access and cyber threats.
Verified: Digital certificates are validated credentials whose contents are maintained in digital databases that record the certification's criteria and contents and make it traceable.
Shareable: Digital certificates are easy to share across all digital platforms including social and networking sites and via mail.
Traceable: With the advancement of technology, there has been a considerable increase in fraudulent practices such as counterfeiting and bogus certifications. Recruiters can use digital certificates to validate the content and source of a credential and qualify the best candidate for the position.
