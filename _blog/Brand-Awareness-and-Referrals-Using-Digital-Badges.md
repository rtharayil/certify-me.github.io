# Brand Awareness and Referrals Using Digital Badges

An organisation that prioritises engagement, awareness, and traffic can be domineering in its pursuit of visibility among the thousands of other digital organisations, social media platforms, websites, and email marketing campaigns. With the increased usage of digital media and platforms, the competition has only gotten stronger, and the necessity to stay relevant has never been more important.

## Brand Awareness Using Digital Badges:

### Digital Badges on Social Media:

When a person is rewarded with a digital badge, they will flaunt about it within their social circles and colleagues, on social media, and professional websites. For example, after successfully completing a project, a person was awarded a Digital Badge. That person decides to share it on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. The brand will get visibility on each platform as a result of people viewing the post. The presentation and visibility of digital badges will also pique people's interest, resulting in brand awareness.

### Digital Badges and Emails:

When a company or educational institution wants to promote its certification programme or training, one of the most efficient marketing strategies is email marketing. When sending emails to prospective members and learners, displaying one's digital badge along with their signature and business emblem fosters a sense of trust and legitimacy in the brand. The use of digital badges contributes to a better understanding and awareness of the brand.

### Referrals Using Digital Badges:

Despite the world's march toward digitalization, the power of word of mouth never fades. People all over the world continue to read reviews, ratings, and comments, which influence their choices and suggestions.

The key to referrals and word-of-mouth marketing is learner or employee satisfaction, as well as the ability to pique learners' interest and involvement. Aside from word-of-mouth marketing, organisations can help to promote referrals through marketing strategies such as referral marketing, affiliate programmes, or testimonials. However apart from these effective methods, here's how digital badges can help with referral strategies:

### Generates referrals through rewards :

Giving pertinent members awards and recognition boosts engagement. If a member receives acknowledgement in the form of digital badges for being a loyal member, completing a task, or progressing through the programme, there will be more potential for word-of-mouth marketing, generating referrals, and recruiting new members through the display of these digital badges. This raises the organization's brand awareness and builds trust among current members.

### 2: Generate referrals through the display of the Digital badges:

Members' good responses encourage prospective learners to respond positively, resulting in significant brand validation. The organisation or association can also boost recommendations by allowing existing members to share and display digital badges via a referral portal, code, or link that they can use on social media, websites, and emails.

### In Conclusion:

Through the use of digital badges, businesses, organisations, and educational institutions can promote their programmes and training. Brand visibility and awareness are increased by sharing and displaying digital badges on digital media. Because digital badges serve as a form of recognition for learners' abilities, they will drive learners’ to promote the business, resulting in referrals and word-of-mouth marketing.
