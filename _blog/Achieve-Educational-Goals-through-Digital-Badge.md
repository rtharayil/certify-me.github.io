# Achieve Educational Goals through Digital Badge

With the changing developments in the learning structure, tools and technologies, it is easier to carry out additional learning practices updating with the changes in the levels of education. Initially, post-completion of the course, diploma or qualification, learners were awarded a diploma or certificate to identify the learners’ competency in the particular subject matter. In addition to that, a new low-stake credential called Digital badges is emerging among new learners.

Digital Badges are verified digital proof of the individual accomplishment in a skill or talent. Digital badges are issued to display individual skills and are still in a developing stage. These digital badges are replacing the traditional physical badge.

Learners love to get recognised for their work and contribution and perform and engage better when they are acknowledged for what they do. This can be done by issuing Digital Badges. Digital Badges could be issued:

- To acknowledge the persons’ engagement

With the help of digital badges, the learner can showcase and display their skills through recognition from the education provider or an authority. Learners can display their badges on social media and social networking sites which in return promotes brand awareness and encourages engagement, curiosity and participation.

As compared to digital certificates, which are given post-completion of the entire course, digital badges can be gained for progressing through the course. For example, Suppose there to achieve a Digital Marketing Course you have to complete the modules for SEO, Content Marketing and Email Marketing. The learner will receive a digital badge for completing each module namely, an SEO expert digital Badge or a Content Marketer Expert badge.

Another reason for acquiring a digital badge is its high-level security that is backed with meta-data, which helps verify the legitimacy of the contents of the badge acquired. This digital badge is also traceable and can be shared across all Digital Platforms.

The Digital badge anatomy includes the name of the issuer, the identity of the recipient and the contents for which the badge is issued. This verifies the legitimacy of the contents of the digital badge and diminishes the chances of getting duplicated or manipulated.
