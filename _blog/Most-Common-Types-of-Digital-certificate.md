## Digital Certificates vs. Digital Signatures: Key Differences 

While often mentioned together in processes like when you [sign a PDF online](https://pdf.net/), digital certificates and digital signatures serve different purposes. A digital certificate is used to confirm the identity of the certificate holder, such as a person or organization. On the other hand, a digital signature ensures that a document or message has not been altered after it was signed. 

In simple terms, a digital certificate tells you who sent the message, while a digital signature assures you that the message content is genuine and untampered.

<br>

## How Digital Certificates Work

Digital certificates operate using a pair of cryptographic keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is included in the digital certificate and can be shared openly, while the private key is kept secure by the certificate owner. 

When data is sent, it is encrypted with the recipient's public key and can only be decrypted using the corresponding private key. This system ensures that only the intended recipient can access the information. Importantly, digital certificates have an expiration date, typically lasting one to two years, after which they must be renewed. This expiration helps maintain security and ensures that outdated certificates are not used.

<br>

## Common Uses of Digital Certificates 

Digital certificates are versatile tools that provide security and trust in various online activities. 

They play a critical role in areas such as:

<ol>

<li class ="mb-4"><b>Email Encryption:</b> Digital certificates encrypt emails, ensuring that only the intended recipient can read the contents. This prevents unauthorized access and protects sensitive information shared via email.</li>

<li class ="mb-4"><b>VPN Authentication:</b> Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) use digital certificates to authenticate users and devices, ensuring that only authorized entities can access the network. This enhances security, especially for remote workers connecting to corporate networks.</li>

<li class ="mb-4"><b>Secure File Sharing:</b> Digital certificates are used to verify the identity of individuals and organizations involved in file transfers. They ensure that the files have not been tampered with during transit and that the parties involved are legitimate.</li>
