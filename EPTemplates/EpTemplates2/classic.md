# About Section
about_text: >
  <p>I am a passionate UI/UX Developer with a strong foundation in frontend development and user-centered design. Currently working at TechCraft Solutions, I specialize in feature enhancement, sprint-based delivery, and production debugging while collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver reliable software solutions.</p>
  <p>My journey in design and development started with a curiosity for creating meaningful user experiences. With hands-on experience as a Lab Assistant at PES University and expertise in both technical implementation and design thinking, I bridge the gap between functionality and aesthetics.</p>
